# Basic Information of this software
This script is programmed in Processing 4.0b8, and tested in Processing 3.5.4, working successfully in both Windows and MacOS. 

To successfully load the videos in it, you have to install the video library firstly. 
The video library I used is called "GStreamer-based video library for Processing". 

Sometimes, the window may be out of the screen due to different resolution of different computers. 

Please feel free to contact me if there is any problem when running this program.
